## **Chapter 1: Recap and Introduction to Advanced Concepts**
1. **Recap of Basic Concepts**
    - Brief overview of Tkinter and event-driven programming
    - A revisit of `Button`, `Label`, `Entry`, and their respective properties.
    - Quick review of basic event handlers and the `command` parameter.

2. **Introduction to Other Widgets**
    - Brief overview of the `Checkbutton` (tick boxes) widget and its use cases.
    - How to capture its state and use it.
  
3. **Introduction to Advanced Event-Driven Concepts**
    - Introducing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in GUIs using examples such as:
        - Coffee shop queue management system
        - Maths quiz app

## **Chapter 2: Dynamic Widgets and Programmatic Interaction**
1. **Programmatic Addition and Removal of Widgets**
    - Creating dynamic interfaces.
    - Using methods to programmatically add/remove widgets (using the Coffee shop queue management and Maths quiz app examples).

2. **Programmatic Updates to Widgets**
    - Without passing parameters to event handlers, we can mainly add and remove widgets. In the next chapter, we will learn how to pass parameters to event handlers so we can update the data (model) and the view (widgets) dynamically.

## **Chapter 3: Advanced Event Handling and Interactivity**
1. Introduction to `lambda` and its use cases.
    - What is `lambda`?
    - Why do we need it in this context?
    - Show its alternative: functions (with default parameters) inside functions.

2. **Advanced Event Handlers**
    - Need to pass parameters to event handlers and why the basic `command` doesn't suffice.
    - Usage of `lambda` to pass parameters to event handlers to update the model and the view.

3. **Opening a New Window (TopLevel)**
    - Introduction to `Toplevel` and its significance.
    - Passing values between the main window (`Tk`) and the new window (`Toplevel`).
